<h2>How to create a Local Repository</h2>
<p>After the intsallation of Git. Go inside the folder to which you want to make repository</p>

<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

  <br>  $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"<br>
    $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com<br>
</p>

<h2>Git Init</h2>

<h3>Add some files</h3>  
<p>After setting up your first repository, remotely and locally, you can start working on your project. You can start by creating a file, doing some work in it, and then adding it to the stage. You can use the following command to view the status of stage:<br>

    git status get stage status<br>
    
    You can use the following command to add files to stage:<br>
    
    git add [file specifier] to add files<br>
